# Overview

The benchmarks follow the criteria:

  - They are written as the average software developer would write them, i.e.

    - The algorithms are implemented as cited in public sources;
    - The used data structures are idiomatic.

  - The used algorithms are similar between the languages (as the reference implementations), variants are acceptable if the reference implementation exists.
  - All final binaries are releases (optimized for performance if possible) as debug performance may vary too much depending on the compiler.
  - Code should not use any library (because we measure the number of lines of code)
  - Code should not exceed 80 chars per line for the same reason stated above
